# MachineLearning_RegressionModelImplemantation

Here i have implemented Regression Model to predit house price. 
I have used Supervised Learning technique for prediction.

Equation:
Ordinary Least Square (OLS)
hypothesis: Y = ßo + ß1(Height)+ error
ß1 = S(xi - xmean)(yi-ymean)/ S (xi - xmean)² where i= 1 to n (no. of obs.)
ßo = ymean - ß1(xmean)
