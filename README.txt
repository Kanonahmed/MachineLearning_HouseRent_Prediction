# MachineLearning_RegressionModelImplemantation

Here i have implemented Regression Model to predit house price. 
I have used Supervised Learning technique for prediction.

Equation:
Ordinary Least Square (OLS)
hypothesis: Y = ßo + ß1(Height)+ J(b0,b1)
ß1 = S(xi - xmean)(yi-ymean)/ S (xi - xmean)² where i= 1 to n (no. of obs.)
ßo = ymean - ß1(xmean)
J(b0,b1)= 1/2*m summation[(h(xi)-yi)**2]
